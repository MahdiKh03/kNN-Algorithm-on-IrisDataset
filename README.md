A simple kNN learning algorithm implementation on the famous iris dataset with a very good accuracy (~96%).
The data set has 150 different examples and each has 4 attributes with a label wich specifies the type of each one.
The training dataset is a random subset from the original iris set and it's two-third of it in the size. And the testing dataset is the remaining one-third.
