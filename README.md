A simple kNN learning algorithm implementation on the famous iris dataset with  very good accuracy (~96%).
The data set has 150 different examples and each has 4 attributes with a label which specifies the type of each one.
The training dataset is a random subset from the original iris set and it's two-thirds of it in  size. And the testing dataset is the remaining one-third.
